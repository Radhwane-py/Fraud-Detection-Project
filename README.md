# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoder with PCA

This project implements an anomaly detection system to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It utilizes an autoencoder neural network to learn the patterns of normal transactions and detect anomalies, which could potentially be fraudulent. The dataset used has been preprocessed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to change the dimensionality in order to protect users' identities and sensitive features and improve performance.

## Project Overview:
The project leverages an autoencoder model to detect credit card fraud by learning to reconstruct normal transactions. The anomaly detection process relies on the reconstruction error; transactions that deviate significantly from the learned pattern of normal transactions are flagged as anomalies.

## Key Features:
Autoencoder for unsupervised anomaly detection.
Data preprocessing with PCA to change dimensionality and reduce noise.
Visualizations using t-SNE to observe how normal and fraudulent transactions differ.
Statistical analysis on detected anomalies versus normal transactions.

## Data Preprocessing:
The dataset used in this project has already been preprocessed with Principal Component Analysis **(PCA)**.
PCA generally reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by transforming the original features into a set of uncorrelated features while retaining as much variance as possible. This preprocessing step enhances the performance of the model by reducing noise and making it easier to detect anomalies.

The Class column in the dataset is used for evaluation:

**0: Normal transaction.**
**1: Fraudulent transaction.**

## Model Details:
The autoencoder model is an unsupervised neural network designed to learn an efficient representation of normal transactions. It consists of:

**Encoder**: Compresses the input data (transactions) into a lower-dimensional representation.
**Decoder**: Reconstructs the original input from the compressed representation.
The model is trained to minimize the reconstruction error on normal transactions. Fraudulent transactions, which differ significantly from normal transactions, will have higher reconstruction errors and will be flagged as anomalies.

## Model Configuration:
encoding_dim: The size of the compressed layer.
threshold_percentile: Percentile of reconstruction error to determine the anomaly detection threshold.
## Visualization and Evaluation:
After detecting anomalies, the project provides several forms of feedback and analysis:

-**Training Loss History:** Visualizes the modelâ€™s training and validation loss over epochs.
-**t-SNE Visualization:** Projects the high-dimensional transaction embeddings into 2D space using t-SNE, providing a visual representation of normal and fraudulent transactions.
-**Reconstruction Error Distribution:** Displays the distribution of reconstruction errors for both normal and fraudulent transactions.
-**Statistical Analysis:** Highlights the differences in feature values between predicted anomalies and normal transactions.
-**Performance Metrics:** The model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and a classification report.

## Using This Project:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Radhwane-py/Fraud-Detection-Project` and then run the command `cd Fraud-Detection-Project`
2. Ensure that you have all the required libraries installed or run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Ensure that your original dataset is in CSV format and contains Class column for fraud labels.
4. Change the dimensions of the original dataset with your desired dimensions **(your desired dimensions should be less or equal to the features of your original dataset)** to reduce its noise by Modifying the filepath in `pca_preprocessor.py` to point to your dataset location.
5. Modify the filepath in `main.py` to point to the generated `pca_results_for_training.csv` dataset location.
6. Run the command `python main.py` to execute the project and save your own detection model.
7. Detect on new transaction(s) by running `detect_on_new_data.py` and entering the transactions features as inputs to check wether the new transaction(s) is/are **Fraudulent** or **Normal**.
